## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using the port
   lsof -i :8082

   # Kill the process or change port in Makefile
   ```

2. **Docker Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Clean Docker cache
   make clean

   # Rebuild from scratch
   make build
   ```

3. **Service Not Starting**
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   make logs-qr  # (or specific service)

   # Verify dependencies
   make install-deps
   ```

4. **Health Check Failures**
   ```bash
   # Wait for services to start (can take 30-60 seconds)
   sleep 30
   make health

   # Check container status
   make status
   ```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Start services with debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug make up

# View detailed logs
make logs
```

## Integration with Project Phases

This Makefile supports the PROJECT_PLAN.md implementation phases:

- **Phase 6.1**: Academic comparison REST services (QR + URL)
- **Phase 6.2**: Extended production services (User + Analytics)
- **Phase 6.3**: Service orchestration and management
- **Phase 8**: Performance testing and comparison

## Best Practices

1. **Always run `make health` after `make up`** to verify services started correctly
2. **Use `make dev-up` for development** to enable hot reload
3. **Run `make test` before committing** to ensure code quality
4. **Use `make clean` regularly** to avoid Docker disk space issues
5. **Check `make status`** to monitor container health over time

## Contributing

When adding new services or commands:

1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Add help text using `## Description` format
3. Use color coding for output (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, NC)
4. Include error handling with `2>/dev/null || true` where appropriate
5. Update this documentation with new commands
