# Distributed Microservices Project Plan - gRPC & REST Comparison

## Overview

This project implements a distributed microservices architecture using **dual implementation approaches**:

1. **Extended 4-Service Architecture**: Mixed protocol system with gRPC services (QR Generator, URL Shortener) and REST services (User Management, Analytics Dashboard) running simultaneously
2. **Academic Comparison Implementation**: Same core services (QR Generator, URL Shortener) implemented in both gRPC and REST/JSON for performance comparison studies

The system features configurable protocol switching in the API Gateway, allowing for comprehensive performance analysis while maintaining a realistic mixed-protocol production architecture.
